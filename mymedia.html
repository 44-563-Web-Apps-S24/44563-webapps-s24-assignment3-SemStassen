    <h1>Sem Stassen</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Sem, 20 years old and studying at NW Missouri as an exchange student
      for the semester. My favourite song at the moment, because it changes
      quite often, is "A divebar named Nirvana" by Dogpark. An up and coming
      band from Chicago, currently touring all over the US.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purely for nostalgic reasons my favourite movie of all time is "The
      prisoner of Azkaban", the 3rd installment of the Harry Potter franchise.
      This movie is where the series becomes a lot more serious and darker,
      there are actual stakes now and you can feel it.

          This video holds a special place in my heart because it was my first
          real introduction to (creative) programming. Shiffman teaches coding
          in a clear, interactive and funny way, keeping my interest high all
          the way to the end.

          As a long time history nerd, Harari provides a short (for history) but
          complete view of most of human history. There is some needed context
          missing here and there, but for anyone wanting to understand more
          about how we got where we are today, this is a great read!

      Below is a snippet of pyhton code, allowing for the creation of abstract
      classes. It allows testing of objects to see if they adhere to specific
      specifications.
    </p>
    <pre>
    from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod


    class BaseClass(metaclass=ABCMeta):
        @abstractmethod
        def foo(self):
            pass

        @abstractmethod
        def bar(self):
            pass


    class ConcreteClass(BaseClass):
        def foo(self):
            pass

        def bar(self):
            pass


    instance = ConcreteClass()
