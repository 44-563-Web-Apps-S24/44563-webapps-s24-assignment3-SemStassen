    <p>
      I'm Sem, 20 years old and studying at NW Missouri as an exchange student
      for the semester. My favourite song at the moment, because it changes
      quite often, is "A divebar named Nirvana" by Dogpark. An up and coming
      band from Chicago, currently touring all over the US.

      Purely for nostalgic reasons my favourite movie of all time is "The
      prisoner of Azkaban", the 3rd installment of the Harry Potter franchise.
      This movie is where the series becomes a lot more serious and darker,
      there are actual stakes now and you can feel it.
